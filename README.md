# Hi, I'm Mike Hadley

I’m a developer, educator and artist who translates creative ideas into code and teaches others how to do the same. My mission is to make the world of technology more accessible – both in terms of who has access to learning materials as well as through introducing people to the creative side of technology.

As a developer, I build web apps, games and playful tools, often focused on helping educators or learners engage with complex systems. Projects range from digital card games for teachers to help them plan new lessons, to interactive experiences that teach financial literacy concepts to youth. I also maintain a set of open source tools to make web game development easier, write about programming and use code as my medium to produce art installations.

As an educator, I have taught creative applications of programming across all ages from middle school game design camps, to college and graduate classes, to adult learners at a code school. I've also taught coding across media from an open source book, to a blog series, and to videos on YouTube.
